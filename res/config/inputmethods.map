# Input methods map file.
#
# Specifies alternative GUI components (read: components other than textfields) 
# that should be shown for some EDL entries or entry types. 
# (empty lines and lines starting with '#' are ignored)
# 
# Syntax for one map entry:
#     {<XSDType> | <XPath>}
#     <inputmethod>
#
# currently available values for <inputmethod>:
#     TEXTFIELD
#     FILECHOOSER
#     DIRCHOOSER
#     COLORCHOOSER
#
# Example 1:
#     /rtExperiment/environment/dataFolder
#     DIRCHOOSER
# 
# Specifies a button that popups a directory chooser for the EDL entry 
# dataFolder.
#
# Example 2:
#     anyURI
#     FILECHOOSER
#
# Specifies a file chooser for every configuration entry that has the type 
# anyURI.
#
# IMPORTANT: 
# Input methods specified with a XPath override input methods specified with a
# XSDtype. So if you define FILECHOOSER for anyURI (example 2) and DIRCHOOSER 
# for /rtExperiment/environment/dataFolder (which is of type anyURI), the 
# dataFolder entry will have a directory chooser component for input. All other  
# entries of type anyURI will have a file chooser.
#
# All XPaths are based on EDL specification v1.4.
